This involves loading the pre-trained model, modifying its classifier head for 14 classes, and training it in two phases: first, by training only the new classifier head (feature extraction) for 15 epochs, and then by fine-tuning the last two transformer blocks along with the classifier head for an additional 10 epochs. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set, including overall accuracy and per-class confusion matrices. Generate plots of training and validation loss and accuracy for both training phases. Finally, provide a detailed description of the DeiT-tiny architecture, compare its performance and characteristics with custom-built and pre-trained CNNs (discuss hypothetically), analyze the advantages and disadvantages of using pre-trained transformers for this task, and discuss the limitations imposed by the ChestMNIST dataset. Conclude with a comprehensive summary of all findings."

        "## DeiT-tiny Transformer Model Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "The DeiT-tiny model is a variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a neural network architecture that applies the transformer model, originally designed for natural language processing, directly to images. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that process images through convolutional layers, ViTs treat images as a sequence of patches, similar to how words form a sequence in text.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Vision Transformer (ViT) and DeiT-tiny\n",
        "\n",
        "The original ViT demonstrated that transformers could perform exceptionally well on image classification tasks when trained on large datasets. DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformers) is an improvement over ViT, specifically designed to achieve competitive performance without requiring massive proprietary datasets. DeiT achieves this by introducing a \"distillation token\" during training, which allows it to learn from a teacher model (often a CNN) and distill its knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "DeiT-tiny is the smallest version within the DeiT family, characterized by a more compact architecture, making it suitable for scenarios where computational resources are limited or faster inference is required.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Input Processing\n",
        "\n",
        "For an input image (e.g., 224x224 pixels), the processing involves several steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Splitting into Patches**: The image is first divided into a grid of fixed-size, non-overlapping square patches (e.g., 16x16 pixels). Each patch is treated as a \"word\" in a sequence.\n",
        "*   **Linear Embedding**: Each 2D image patch is flattened into a 1D sequence of pixels and then projected into a higher-dimensional embedding space using a linear layer. This converts each patch into a vector representation.\n",
        "*   **Class Token**: A learnable \"class token\" (or `[CLS]` token, similar to BERT) is prepended to the sequence of patch embeddings. This token's final state after passing through the transformer encoder is used for classification.\n",
        "*   **Positional Embeddings**: To retain spatial information, which is lost when flattening patches, learnable 1D positional embeddings are added to the patch and class token embeddings. This allows the model to understand the relative positions of the patches within the original image.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Transformer Encoder Core Components\n",
        "\n",
        "The core of DeiT-tiny, like other ViTs, is a standard transformer encoder, consisting of a stack of identical layers. Each layer typically contains:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)**: This is the most crucial component. It allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence (image patches) relative to each other. Multi-head attention performs this process multiple times in parallel with different linear projections, allowing the model to focus on different aspects of the input. For an image, this means the model can learn relationships between distant patches.\n",
        "*   **Layer Normalization**: Applied before and after each MHSA and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) block. It normalizes the inputs across the features, helping stabilize training and improve performance.\n",
        "*   **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**: A simple position-wise multilayer perceptron (MLP) applied independently to each token's embedding. It consists of two linear transformations with a GELU activation in between.\n",
        "*   **Residual Connections**: Skip connections are used around both the MHSA and FFN blocks, followed by Layer Normalization, to facilitate gradient flow and enable deeper networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. 'Tiny' Aspect of DeiT-tiny\n",
        "\n",
        "The 'tiny' designation for DeiT-tiny (specifically `deit_tiny_patch16_224`) refers to its compact architecture parameters compared to larger ViT or DeiT models:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Number of Layers**: It typically has 12 transformer encoder blocks.\n",
        "*   **Embedding Dimension**: The patch embeddings are projected into a relatively small dimension (e.g., 192). This directly impacts the size of the attention mechanisms and FFNs.\n",
        "*   **Attention Heads**: It uses a smaller number of attention heads (e.g., 3 heads), which also contributes to computational efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "This reduced complexity allows DeiT-tiny to be faster and require less memory, albeit potentially with a slight trade-off in accuracy compared to its larger counterparts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Distillation Token\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the unique features of DeiT, including DeiT-tiny, is the **distillation token**. During training, an additional learnable token is introduced alongside the class token and patch embeddings. This distillation token is designed to mimic the output of a pre-trained teacher model (e.g., a strong ResNet or EfficientNet). The loss function includes a distillation loss component that forces the distillation token's output to match the teacher's prediction, effectively transferring knowledge from the teacher to the student (DeiT) model. After training, the distillation token can be discarded, and the standard class token is used for inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Classifier Head for Multi-label Classification (ChestMNIST)\n",
        "\n",
        "After the sequence of tokens (class token, distillation token, and patch embeddings) passes through the transformer encoder layers, the output corresponding to the **class token** is typically used for downstream tasks. For multi-label classification on the ChestMNIST dataset (which has 14 possible labels):\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The final embedding vector of the class token from the last transformer encoder layer is extracted.\n",
        "*   This vector is then fed into a simple **Linear layer** (also known as the classifier head).\n",
        "*   The output dimension of this linear layer is set to the number of classes (14 in ChestMNIST).\n",
        "*   Since ChestMNIST is a multi-label classification problem, the output of the linear layer is typically passed through a **sigmoid activation function** to produce a probability for each of the 14 classes independently. Each probability indicates the likelihood of a specific condition being present in the X-ray image."

        "When evaluating the DeiT-tiny model on the ChestMNIST dataset, it's insightful to compare its characteristics and expected performance against two other common approaches: custom-built Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pre-trained CNNs (e.g., ResNet, VGG).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Performance (Accuracy and Handling Complex Patterns):\n",
        "*   **DeiT-tiny (Transformer-based):** Transformers like DeiT-tiny excel at capturing long-range dependencies and global contextual information across the entire image. This can be highly beneficial for medical images like Chest X-rays where subtle, distributed patterns might indicate pathologies. Pre-training on large datasets (like ImageNet) allows it to learn rich visual features. Its attention mechanism can explicitly focus on relevant regions. In this task, the DeiT-tiny achieved an overall test accuracy of **0.9454**. Given its sophisticated architecture and pre-training on a vast dataset, it's expected to perform well, potentially outperforming simpler CNNs, especially if complex, non-local features are crucial.\n",
        "*   **Custom-built CNNs:** The performance of a custom CNN heavily depends on its architecture design, depth, and the amount of data it's trained on. For ChestMNIST, a well-designed custom CNN could achieve decent accuracy, but it might struggle with very subtle patterns or require more data to learn robust features from scratch. Their inductive biases (locality and translation equivariance) are well-suited for image data, but they might miss global relationships that transformers can capture more easily.\n",
        "*   **Pre-trained CNNs (e.g., ResNet, VGG):** Pre-trained CNNs, like DeiT-tiny, benefit immensely from transfer learning. They have already learned powerful hierarchical features from large datasets. By fine-tuning these models, they can achieve very high performance, often surpassing custom-built CNNs, especially when the target dataset (ChestMNIST) is relatively small or has limited variability. They are generally robust and good at capturing local and semi-global patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Convergence Speed:\n",
        "*   **DeiT-tiny:** Due to the complexity of transformer architectures and the presence of many parameters (even in 'tiny' versions), training from scratch can be slow. However, with transfer learning, as performed here (feature extraction followed by fine-tuning), the convergence for the head-only training is typically fast, as only a small part of the network is updated. Fine-tuning the deeper layers can be slower but generally faster than training from scratch. Our phase 1 (head-only) converged quite quickly (within ~5 epochs) and phase 2 (fine-tuning) showed further improvements.\n",
        "*   **Custom-built CNNs:** Training a custom CNN from scratch typically requires more epochs to converge compared to using pre-trained models. The convergence speed is highly dependent on the model's depth, the complexity of the task, and the availability of data. Overfitting can be a challenge if the dataset is small.\n",
        "*   **Pre-trained CNNs:** Similar to DeiT-tiny, fine-tuning pre-trained CNNs (especially just the classifier head initially) tends to converge relatively quickly. The pre-learned features accelerate the learning process for the new task. Fine-tuning deeper layers takes longer but still benefits from the initialized weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Generalization Capabilities:\n",
        "*   **DeiT-tiny:** With its attention mechanism and pre-training, DeiT-tiny is expected to generalize well, especially to variations in X-ray images, as it learns highly abstract and robust features. The ability to model global context helps in understanding diverse image layouts. Its strong performance on the validation and test sets confirms this.\n",
        "*   **Custom-built CNNs:** Generalization can be a challenge for custom CNNs, particularly if the training data is limited or not diverse enough. They might overfit to the training set and perform poorly on unseen data. Careful regularization and architecture design are crucial.\n",
        "*   **Pre-trained CNNs:** Pre-trained CNNs generally exhibit strong generalization capabilities due to their extensive pre-training on diverse datasets. The features learned are often transferable to new domains, allowing them to perform well on unseen medical images, even with relatively small fine-tuning datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Impact of Training Data:\n",
        "*   **DeiT-tiny:** Transformers are generally data-hungry. While pre-training helps significantly, effective fine-tuning for complex tasks often benefits from substantial amounts of labeled data. For smaller datasets like ChestMNIST, transfer learning is almost a necessity for DeiT-tiny to achieve good performance.\n",
        "*   **Custom-built CNNs:** These models are highly sensitive to the amount of training data. They require large, diverse datasets to learn robust and generalizable features from scratch. With limited data, they are very prone to overfitting.\n",
        "*   **Pre-trained CNNs:** These models are more data-efficient for new tasks compared to custom CNNs, as they leverage knowledge from large source datasets. They can achieve good performance even with moderately sized target datasets, but more data always helps in further fine-tuning and adapting to the specific target domain."

        "\n",
        "### Advantages of Pre-trained Transformers\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Leveraging Large-Scale Pre-training**: Pre-trained transformer models like DeiT-tiny have been trained on vast datasets (e.g., ImageNet), learning rich, generalizable features. This is particularly beneficial for medical imaging tasks where acquiring large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets can be challenging and expensive. Transferring these learned representations helps in kickstarting the model's performance even with smaller domain-specific datasets like ChestMNIST.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Capturing Global Context**: Transformers inherently use self-attention mechanisms that allow them to model long-range dependencies and capture global contextual information across the entire image. This is a significant advantage over traditional CNNs, which typically capture local features through convolutional filters and require deeper architectures or larger receptive fields to grasp global context. For X-ray images, understanding the overall structure and relationships between different regions can be crucial for accurate diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Strong Transfer Learning Capabilities**: Due to their sophisticated architecture and extensive pre-training, transformers excel at transfer learning. They can adapt effectively to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning, especially when the target domain is visually similar to the pre-training domain. This allows for rapid prototyping and deployment of high-performing models in specialized fields like medical image analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Scalability**: Transformers are highly scalable models. With more data and computational resources, they tend to continue improving performance, suggesting a strong potential for even better results as datasets grow.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Disadvantages of Pre-trained Transformers\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Computational Cost**: Transformers, especially larger variants, are significantly more computationally intensive than CNNs, both during training and inference. Even DeiT-tiny, while more efficient than larger Vision Transformers, requires substantial resources. This can be a barrier for researchers or practitioners with limited access to high-end GPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Data-Hunger (even with Transfer Learning)**: While transfer learning mitigates some of this, transformers are fundamentally data-hungry models. For them to fully leverage their architectural capabilities and not just rely heavily on the pre-trained weights, a reasonably sized dataset for fine-tuning is often necessary. If the target dataset (ChestMNIST) is extremely small or has very specific characteristics not seen during pre-training, performance might not be optimal, and overfitting could still occur if not carefully managed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Potential for Overfitting on Small Datasets**: Despite transfer learning, if fine-tuning is not performed carefully, particularly when unfreezing more layers or using aggressive learning rates on smaller datasets, transformers can still overfit. The high number of parameters in transformers makes them prone to memorizing training data rather than generalizing, especially when the task is simple or the dataset is limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Complexity of Interpretation**: Compared to CNNs, which can sometimes have their feature maps visualized to understand what they are 'looking at', interpreting the decisions of transformer models can be more complex. The attention mechanisms distribute importance across various patches, making it harder to pinpoint specific image regions that drive a particular diagnosis, which is a critical aspect in medical applications requiring explainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Requirement for Specific Input Format**: Transformers often require input images to be divided into patches, which adds a preprocessing step and might sometimes lose fine-grained spatial information if patch sizes are too large or if the image resolution is small relative to the patch size."

        "### Discussion of ChestMNIST Dataset Limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "The ChestMNIST dataset, while valuable for benchmarking, presents several limitations that can significantly impact the performance and training of advanced models like the DeiT-tiny transformer:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Small Size and Limited Diversity:** ChestMNIST contains a relatively small number of images (78,468 for training, 11,219 for validation, and 22,433 for testing) compared to the vast datasets used to pre-train models like DeiT (e.g., ImageNet with millions of images). This limited size, combined with potentially limited diversity in patient demographics, imaging equipment, and clinical variations, restricts the model's exposure to a wide range of real-world scenarios. This can lead to:\n",
        "    *   **Poor Generalization:** The model might learn patterns specific to the training set and struggle to generalize to unseen data with different characteristics.\n",
        "    *   **Overfitting:** Despite using techniques like freezing layers and fine-tuning, the model can still overfit to the limited patterns present in ChestMNIST, especially for the unfrozen layers and the new classifier head.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Potential Class Imbalances:** Medical datasets often suffer from significant class imbalances, where certain conditions are much rarer than others. As observed in the per-class confusion matrices from the evaluation, some classes (e.g., 'pneumonia', 'hernia', 'fibrosis') have very few positive samples (true positives + false negatives). This imbalance poses challenges:\n",
        "    *   **Bias towards Majority Classes:** The model tends to perform well on abundant classes but poorly on rare ones, as there isn't enough data to learn robust features for the minority classes. This can be seen in the low number of true positives for some conditions (e.g., 'nodule', 'pneumonia', 'emphysema', 'fibrosis', 'pleural', 'hernia') leading to a high number of false negatives or low recall for these specific conditions.\n",
        "    *   **Challenges in Per-Class Accuracy:** Achieving high and consistent per-class accuracy for all 14 conditions, especially the rarer ones, becomes extremely difficult. The model might effectively act as a strong baseline predictor for common conditions but fail to reliably detect rare diseases.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Original Image Characteristics (28x28 pixels, grayscale):** Although images are resized to 224x224 and converted to 3 channels for DeiT, the original ChestMNIST images are 28x28 pixels and grayscale. This inherently limits the amount of high-resolution, fine-grained detail available in the images. Resizing up-samples the image but does not magically create new information. This lack of initial detail means:\n",
        "    *   **Information Loss:** Critical diagnostic features might be lost or become ambiguous at such low resolutions, even after resizing.\n",
        "    *   **Reduced Effectiveness of Transformer's Attention Mechanism:** While transformers excel at capturing global dependencies, the limited detail in the original images means there's less meaningful information for the attention mechanism to focus on, potentially hindering its ability to extract complex features pertinent to various pathologies.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the ChestMNIST dataset's small size, limited diversity, and the low intrinsic resolution of its original images, coupled with potential class imbalances, create significant hurdles for a pre-trained transformer model. Even with the power of transfer learning from ImageNet, these dataset-specific limitations mean the model may struggle with generalization, be prone to overfitting to specific quirks of the data, and find it particularly challenging to achieve high and reliable diagnostic accuracy across all medical conditions, especially the rare ones."

        "\n",
        "This project successfully implemented and evaluated a DeiT-tiny transformer model for multi-label classification on the ChestMNIST dataset. The training process was divided into two distinct phases: feature extraction and fine-tuning, followed by a comprehensive evaluation on the test set and a discussion of architectural characteristics, comparisons, and dataset limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Two-Phase Training Process:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 1: Feature Extraction (15 Epochs)**\n",
        "During this phase, only the newly added classifier head was trained, while the main body of the pre-trained DeiT-tiny model remained frozen. The training was performed with a batch size of 32 and an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3. The training and validation loss curves showed a rapid initial decrease, followed by a plateau, indicating that the feature extractor was effectively learning to map the pre-extracted features to the 14 ChestMNIST classes. The accuracy curves mirrored this behavior, quickly reaching a high level and then stabilizing. The model quickly leveraged the powerful pre-trained features from DeiT, minimizing the need for extensive training in this phase.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 2: Fine-tuning (10 Epochs)**\n",
        "In the second phase, the learning rate was reduced to 1e-4, and the batch size was set to 16. The last two transformer blocks of the DeiT-tiny model, along with the classifier head, were unfrozen and fine-tuned. The plots show a continued, albeit slower, decrease in training loss and a slight improvement in training accuracy. Validation loss and accuracy showed some fluctuations, suggesting that while the model was further optimizing, there might have been a subtle trade-off between exploiting the pre-trained knowledge and adapting to the specific nuances of ChestMNIST, or potentially some overfitting as training loss continued to decrease while validation metrics plateaued or slightly declined towards the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Final Model Evaluation on the Test Set:\n",
        "\n",
        "The fully trained model achieved an **Overall Test Accuracy of 0.9454**. While this overall accuracy appears high, a deeper look into the per-class confusion matrices revealed significant disparities in performance across different classes. For multi-label classification, accuracy is calculated across all labels and samples. For instance, classes with a large number of true negatives (correctly predicting the absence of a condition) would inflate the overall accuracy, even if the model performs poorly on true positives for rare conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notable patterns/issues in per-class confusion matrices:**\n",
        "*   **High True Negatives (TN) and Low True Positives (TP) for rare classes:** Many classes, such as 'pneumonia', 'consolidation', 'edema', 'emphysema', 'fibrosis', and 'hernia', showed a very high number of true negatives and very low true positives. For example, 'pneumonia' had 22191 TNs but 0 TPs, indicating the model almost always predicted the absence of pneumonia, likely due to its rarity in the dataset. This leads to a high accuracy for these specific classes on predicting absence, but a complete failure to detect the positive cases.\n",
        "*   **Relatively better performance for common classes:** Classes like 'atelectasis', 'effusion', and 'infiltration' showed a more balanced distribution of true positives and false negatives, indicating the model was better at detecting these conditions, likely due to a higher prevalence in the training data.\n",
        "*   **Class Imbalance Impact:** The extreme class imbalance in ChestMNIST is evident in these results. The model tends to be conservative and predicts the majority class (absence of a condition) for rare conditions, leading to poor recall for those conditions, even with high overall accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### DeiT-tiny Architecture:\n",
        "\n",
        "The DeiT-tiny model is a vision transformer that leverages a transformer encoder, similar to those used in natural language processing. It divides an input image into fixed-size patches, linearly embeds them, adds positional encodings, and feeds them into a stack of transformer blocks. Each transformer block consists of a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) module and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The key components contributing to its performance are:\n",
        "*   **Patch Embeddings:** Converting image patches into a sequence of tokens allows the transformer to process visual data.\n",
        "*   **Positional Encodings:** Provides spatial information since transformers are permutation-invariant.\n",
        "*   **Multi-Head Self-Attention:** Enables the model to weigh the importance of different patches relative to each other, capturing global dependencies across the entire image.\n",
        "*   **Deeper Architecture (Blocks):** Stacking multiple transformer blocks allows for hierarchical feature extraction and more complex representations.\n",
        "*   **Distillation Token (DeiT specific):** DeiT includes a distillation token that interacts with the class token and patch tokens, learning from a teacher model (often a CNN) to improve performance without requiring large datasets or teacher models during inference. This helps DeiT achieve competitive performance with CNNs using only image patches.\n",
        "\n",
        "For ChestMNIST, the pre-trained weights from ImageNet enable the DeiT-tiny to learn powerful general image representations, which are then adapted to medical images through fine-tuning.\n",

        "### Comparison with Custom-Built and Pre-trained CNNs (Hypothetical Discussion):\n",
        "\n",
        "**Performance:**\n",
        "*   **DeiT-tiny:** Achieves a high overall accuracy (0.9454), but struggles with rare classes due to class imbalance and the inherent challenges of multi-label classification in highly imbalanced datasets.\n",
        "*   **Custom-Built CNNs:** Often require extensive architectural search and large amounts of data to reach competitive performance. Without pre-training, they might struggle to learn robust features from medical images, which are typically limited in quantity. They would likely also exhibit similar issues with class imbalance unless explicitly addressed.\n",
        "*   **Pre-trained CNNs (e.g., ResNet, VGG):** Similar to DeiT-tiny, pre-trained CNNs would benefit significantly from transfer learning. They often show strong performance on medical imaging tasks, especially when fine-tuned. Depending on the architecture, pre-trained CNNs might offer slightly better or worse performance on specific patterns compared to DeiT, but general trends regarding rare diseases and class imbalance would persist.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Convergence:**\n",
        "*   **DeiT-tiny:** Rapid convergence of the classifier head during feature extraction due to powerful pre-trained features. Fine-tuning also converges relatively quickly, benefiting from the initialized weights.\n",
        "*   **Custom-Built CNNs:** Can have slower convergence if trained from scratch, especially with complex architectures and limited data. Requires careful hyperparameter tuning.\n",
        "*   **Pre-trained CNNs:** Generally exhibit fast convergence during fine-tuning, similar to pre-trained transformers, as they leverage existing knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Generalization:**\n",
        "*   **DeiT-tiny:** Good generalization due to pre-training on a diverse dataset (ImageNet), allowing it to extract generalizable features. However, its generalization to specific rare conditions in ChestMNIST might be limited by the dataset's characteristics.\n",
        "*   **Custom-Built CNNs:** Generalization can vary widely depending on the architecture, training data size, and regularization. Often prone to overfitting on smaller medical datasets.\n",
        "*   **Pre-trained CNNs:** Offer strong generalization capabilities due to pre-training, which helps prevent overfitting and improves performance on unseen data, including medical images.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages and Disadvantages of Pre-trained Transformers:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "*   **Strong Feature Extraction:** Transformers, especially vision transformers, are excellent at capturing long-range dependencies and global contextual information within images, which can be crucial for medical diagnoses.\n",
        "*   **Transfer Learning:** Pre-training on large datasets like ImageNet provides a powerful starting point, enabling competitive performance even with smaller domain-specific datasets (like ChestMNIST).\n",
        "*   **Scalability:** Transformers are highly scalable with increasing data and model size, potentially leading to state-of-the-art results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages:**\n",
        "*   **Computational Cost:** Transformers are generally more computationally expensive and memory-intensive to train and fine-tune than many CNNs, especially for high-resolution images.\n",
        "*   **Data Requirements:** While pre-training mitigates this, training transformers from scratch typically requires very large datasets. Even with fine-tuning, smaller batch sizes (e.g., 16 in phase 2) might be necessary due to memory constraints.\n",
        "*   **Interpretability:** Understanding the specific visual features a transformer attends to can be more complex than with CNNs, though tools for interpretability are evolving.\n",

        "### Limitations of the ChestMNIST Dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "The ChestMNIST dataset, despite its utility, presents several limitations that significantly impact model training and evaluation:\n",
        "*   **Low Resolution (28x28 pixels originally):** The original images are very small, requiring resizing to 224x224 for models like DeiT. This upsampling can introduce interpolation artifacts and may not capture the fine-grained details often critical for medical diagnosis. The model essentially works with interpolated data, not truly higher-resolution information.\n",
        "*   **Single-Channel (Grayscale):** The images are grayscale, which was addressed by repeating the single channel three times to fit the 3-channel input expectation of pre-trained models. While this allows compatibility, it does not add new information, potentially limiting the model's ability to learn diverse color-based features (though less relevant for X-rays).\n",
        "*   **Extreme Class Imbalance:** This is the most significant limitation. Some conditions are extremely rare (e.g., 'pneumonia', 'hernia'), leading to very few positive samples. As observed in the confusion matrices, the model tends to predict the absence of these rare conditions, resulting in high overall accuracy but very poor recall for the positive cases. This makes it challenging to build a model that is genuinely sensitive to all conditions.\n",
        "*   **Simplified Labels:** The labels are binary (presence/absence of a condition). While useful, they lack the nuanced information (e.g., severity, location) that a radiologist would use.\n",
        "\n",
        "These limitations imply that while the DeiT-tiny model achieves a high overall accuracy, its practical utility for detecting certain rare but critical conditions on ChestMNIST might be limited due to the dataset's characteristics, especially the severe class imbalance and low original image resolution."
